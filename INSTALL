Installing midi2ariston
=======================

The tools can run directly from the git checkout. Proper setup.py is
still on the todo list.

Requirements
------------

Cairo
.....

midi2ariston is based on the cairo graphics library. It supports both the
PyPi version *cairocffi* and python-cairo that might be shipped with your
distribution.

python-midi
...........

For reading midi file the python-midi is used that can be found at

The master branch is Python 2 only. There is a Python 3 branch which
is untested with midi2ariston. I also have a branch that has less
invasive Python 3 compatiblility patches that has not yet been merged
upstream:
